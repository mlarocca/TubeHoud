#Tube Hound
**Tube Hound** is a video search aggregator. In other words, it is supposed to assist you in your quest for videos over the Internet.
The main idea behind **Tube Hound** is as simple as a flow of thoughts. Actually, it is exactly a flow of thoughts: ever tried to follow a chain of thoughts, and see were they lead you? Usually it is in some unexpected and yet surprisingly meaningful place. 

We think you could do the same with a video search: you start searching what's on your mind, we try to show you some results for that query together with other videos related with those results; you can take a look, see if you find something you like, and add it to a playlist for a later vision. Then again, you might have found something interesting related to what you were searching: that's great! You are just one click away from refocusing your search on that new topic. And then... you start again from square one: the playlist will be your memory anyway.
